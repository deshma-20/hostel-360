# Create PWA Icons

You need two icon files for the PWA to work properly:

## Required Icons:
- `public/logo1.png` (192x192 pixels)
- `public/logo2.png` (512x512 pixels)

## Quick Creation Methods:

### Option 1: Online Generator (Easiest)
1. Visit: https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
2. Upload your logo/icon image
3. Download generated icons
4. Place in `public/` folder

### Option 2: Use Canva
1. Create 512x512 design
2. Add "H360" or hostel icon
3. Download as PNG
4. Resize to 192x192 for smaller icon

### Option 3: Simple Placeholder (For Now)
Use any square image (logo, photo) and save as:
- `logo1.png` (at least 192x192)
- `logo2.png` (at least 512x512)

## Recommended Design:
- Purple background (#8b5cf6)
- White "H360°" text
- Or hostel building icon
- Keep it simple and recognizable

The app will work without icons but won't show proper icon when installed.
